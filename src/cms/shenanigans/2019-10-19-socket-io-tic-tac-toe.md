brief: Multiplayer Tic-Tac-Toe
full-description: >-
  This project was built so that I could explore Socket.IO and test out some
  features that I previously had never used. You can join or start games and
  play live with other players. Since this project was mainly to explore
  Socket.IO, there isn't much mobile responsiveness or form validation.
