brief: Social media emergency management dashboard
full-description: >-
  This project was made for a non-profit specializing in social media emergency
  management. The goal was to give their staff a high level/real time overview
  of US based disasters and connect them with different informational insights.


  These insights included social media analysis generated from Twitter's
  streaming API, state/city weather data and alerts, ArcGIS layers and maps, and
  an organized list of in depth state resources drawn from the organizations
  Google Docs database.
