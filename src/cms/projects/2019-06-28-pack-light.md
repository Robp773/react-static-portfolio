brief: Simple pack management app for ultralight backpacking
full-description: >-
  I built this app to help ultralight backpackers keep track of their base pack
  weight and make decisions about what gear to bring. In ultralight backpacking
  a few ounces is a big deal so I also added in pack stats and charts to help
  users visualize their pack's makeup. Users can also save different packing
  lists to their accounts.
