brief: Side by side news coverage comparison
full-description: >-
  A simple **React based** app to **compare news coverage** of different media
  outlets side by side. Searching for a news related term will bring up the most
  **relevant content from media sources** along with a **word cloud** to help
  users quickly **understand the points of view** being emphasized. 


  Links to news articles are provided along with a button to calculate the
  sentiment of the article - (negative, positive, or neutral). This sentiment
  analysis was originally intended to be run on all news articles without being
  manually triggered by users but I was limited by the free tier of the text
  analytics API.
