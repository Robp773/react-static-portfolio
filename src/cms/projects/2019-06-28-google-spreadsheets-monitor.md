brief: Google Spreadsheet Analysis
full-description: >-
  This app was built to help a non-profit gain a better understanding of the
  data they stored in a Google Sheets database. This database was made up of
  about ten different categories of links and Twitter accounts separated by
  dozens of separate spreadsheets. 


  Since the database was entirely made up of links - I created a scanning
  function that would test the validity/response time of each URL and also
  return the locations of any blank/incomplete cells. These results were fed
  into charts and statistical summaries to help users gain a better
  understanding of the data. 


  The scanning function also had a callback that color coded the invalid Google
  Sheets cells so that users could more easily address gaps in the data.
