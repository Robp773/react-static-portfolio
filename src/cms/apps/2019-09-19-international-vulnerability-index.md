brief: Dashboard to display vulnerability indicators and data of different countries
full-description: >-
  The International Vulnerability Index app was made to help a US government
  stakeholder gain a high level understanding of international vulnerability
  indicators inside multiple countries. Some examples of vulnerability
  indicators would be national life expectancy, statistics on violence against
  women, or renewable energy use.


  The app combines a variety of different real time, near real time, and static
  data sources to showcase important information about each country. 


  The layout of the app is broken into data feeds on the left and more static
  data on the right. The left column displays a curated twitter feed of
  important actors in the region, detailed weather data for important cities
  inside the country, a news feed with custom search parameters, and an
  additional feed of Relief Web reports and media. 


  The right side column includes social media, website, and contact information
  for important national businesses and government offices in addition to tabs
  focusing on energy and country specific data taken from the CIA World
  Factbook. 


  The last element is the resilience indicator chart that visually summarizes
  data taken from other parts of the app to help the user compare the current
  country to the rest of the world.
