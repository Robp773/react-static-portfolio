brief: Non-profit site focusing on student athlete volunteering
full-description: >-
  For this project the goal was to create a site that educated visitors about
  the goals of the non-profit and also enabled them to register/participate in
  volunteer opportunities. The client was also looking to use a CMS to update
  content having used WordPress in the past.


  To accomplish these goals I built out the site using React Static, Netlify
  CMS, and a custom API for volunteer registration/management. React Static and
  Netlify CMS allow the site to load content quickly and give the site owner a
  way to add new volunteer opportunities through the back end.  The API allows
  users to register for opportunities, edit their past registrations, and
  change/update their personal information. 


  I also built out a password protected admin page where the site owner can view
  charts and summaries of volunteer contributions. This is used to determine
  which student athletes are awarded scholarships.
