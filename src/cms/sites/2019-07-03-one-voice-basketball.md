brief: Site made for a local basketball program.
full-description: >-
  The goals for this project were to create a place where visitors can learn
  more/sign up to join the program and to also create a database for the site
  owner's blog posts and basketball drills. 


  For the basketball drills, I created a database organized by the type of drill
  and difficulty using advanced custom fields. The front end of the website
  displays these drills in an organized/easy to read way and the back end admin
  dashboard allows the site owner to quickly add new drills on the fly. 


  The notes page is supported by a similar back end/front end but is a
  relatively standard design for WordPress sites.


  I also created a simple system to notify the site owner whenever someone wants
  to buy any program merchandise. Users can select the items they want to buy,
  view their order totals, and submit their order which then sends an automatic
  email to the site admin so that he can bring the items to the next practice.
