brief: What's under the hood with this site
full-description: >-
  It might be a little weird to reference my own portfolio as a project but I
  wanted to have a place where site visitors can see whats going on under the
  hood. The site is built with the static site generator React Static and pulls
  in data from a number of different sources.


  To display my GitHub data - the site makes a series of requests that are
  eventually compiled into a list of public commits and a list of my GitHub user
  data. The commits are displayed on the activity page and the GitHub user data
  is displayed on the home page (The "As of X days ago" is the number of days
  since my GitHub account was created).


  The site also pulls in data from CodeWars and DevTo to show my latest coding
  challenges/blog activity.


  Since all of these requests are only made when the static site is
  built/rebuilt - I ran into the problem of outdated data being displayed if the
  site had not been rebuilt recently. In order to address this I used a Zapier
  webhook to rebuild the site daily and keep everything up to date. 


  Lastly, for my projects, sites, and random coding shenanigans, I used Netlify
  CMS so that I could have an interface to update the site on the fly. Whenever
  I enter a new project through the CMS, the entire site is rebuilt with the new
  static content. 


  The result of all this is a site that is very easy to maintain on my end but
  also fast and easy to use for site visitors.
